# dotfiles
as of this commit (2024-03-16), my (bleeding edge) setup is: 
- operating system: nixos
- terminal: alacritty
- shell: nushell
- editor: helix
- window-manager: hyprland
- compositor: wayland

i switched to nix today, so the nix-related configs here are trash. i have no clue what i am doing wrt. nix and hyprland. the rest works fine
