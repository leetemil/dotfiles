# dotfiles
My dotfiles. Is probably a big fat fork from https://github.com/Parth/dotfiles

I know at least one dependency, which is the [starship prompt](starship.rs). 
It can be installed using
```
curl -fsSL https://starship.rs/install.sh | bash
```

Also, antibody is deprecated as far as I know. Maybe find a replacement. Also, `prompt.sh` is replaced by starship.
