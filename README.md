# dotfiles
current setup is: 
- operating system: nixos
- terminal: alacritty
- shell: nushell
- editor: helix
- window-manager: hyprland
- compositor: wayland

on my todo:
- [ ] bundle user-config files into a nix expression. I hope that I can use home-manager without having to rip the actual config files apart, into nix expressions. I am going to keep the config that each tool was born with, not the nix overlay.
